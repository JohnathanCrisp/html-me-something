                Whenever I was about five years old, I went to thanksgiving dinner with my family in Dallas, Texas. My Nana had just gotten back from the grocery store and asked
            me and my cousin Drew, who was also my age, to help her put away the groceries. After getting most of the groceries put away. all that was left was the turkey. My Nana
            asked us to put the turkey in the deep freeze, which was out in the garage, so the both of us headed to the garage with the turkey and set it inside of the deep freeze.

                While we were in the garage, Drew thought it would be funny to play a joke on my Nana and put the cat in the deep freeze with the turkey so when she came to get it the cat would
            jump out and scare her. <b>Being five years old, I thought this was hilarious and harmless so we set the cat, &#34;Gidget&#34;, into the deep freeze and headed back inside chuckling the entire way.</b>
            We got back inside and it turned out that my grandmother had actually forgotten to get some things for dinner at the grocery store, so she sent Drew and I with my father
            to the supermarket to grab the rest of the stuff for dinner while she started preparing other things for the dinner.

            It's important to note here that the supermarket was about a forty&#8209;five minute drive. So there and back, without the time of shopping is a minimum of an hour and a half

                Whenever we arrived back from the supermarket, about two and a half hours later, Drew and I could barely contain our laughter when we walked through the door.
                We asked Nana, &#34;So how about that turkey?&#34;. I will forever remember her face because she replied,  &#34;Oh sh*t boys, I forgot to get the turkey out and start it!&#34;.
                Of course our hearts instantly sank, and we both started rambling about how it was no big deal and we would go and get the turkey for her right then no hesitation.

                Drew and I basically sprinted to the garage and opened the deep freeze to find poor Gidget, stiff as a board and pulled her out. She was set on the ground standing but not
                moving a muscle. The only thing she was moving was her eyes, back and forth, but other than that no movement at all. We were, to say the least, freaking out. No idea what to do
                scrambling back and forth until Drew gets a bright idea. He wanted to warm her up and there was some gasoline sitting in the corner of the garage. So he grabs the gas can and brings it
                over to gidget. We take off the gas cap and slowly fill the cap up with just the smallest amount of gasoline. After that we gently pried gidgets mouth open and poured the cap
                of gasoline down her throat thinking that it would warm her up. I'm not even kidding you when I say that cat hopped straight up, ran in a circle three times, and then fell over...
